Multiscale modeling:
 * Accuracy vs sampling
 * Modeling methods
* Overriding the compromise:
    - multiscale
    - Software fragmentation: we need adaptors and converters
    - Graphical suites: commercial and academic
    - Python scripting: modularity for everyone
* Abusing modularity, breaking the chain: todos juegan con todos: GaudiMM: la energÃ­a ya no va por encima de la estructura
    - Scarce info ->
        - lack of structures: generate them
        - Lack of parameters: do you really need them now?
        - answer hypotheses "if this was possible, how would it be?" -> first answer, is this possible?
