To prove their usage and applicability in molecular modeling, a series of illustrative cases will be described in detail. These include toy examples that showcase the potentiality of GaudiMM –some of them unreachable with standard methodologies–, like siderophore chelation, standard and exotic docking protocols, ligand design and metal binding site prediction.
