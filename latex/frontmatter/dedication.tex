% \noindent To Pedro Pablo Modro√±o de la Rosa, \\
% who showed me the wonders of Science.

\noindent \itshape In the beginning, there was nothing. \\
\itshape And God said \guillemotleft Let there be light\guillemotright. \\
\itshape And there was light. \\
\itshape There was still nothing, \\
\itshape but you could see it a lot better. \\ \\
