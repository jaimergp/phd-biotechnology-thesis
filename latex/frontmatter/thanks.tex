\Lettrine{I} did not have any intentions of doing a Ph.D. So I guess it is only fair to first thank those who got me here ---directly or indirectly.

Father, you got me into science. Answering trivia on astronomy on the way to (often late) school or collecting shells of questionable origin is one of my more treasured memories. Speaking of school, teachers: Paco, Narciso, Tulio, Salvador, Carlos, Javi. Your guidance and motivation cannot be neglected.

My Biotechnology degree classmates, thanks for that conversation in our last dinner. Had not that taken place, I would not be here. You convinced me to pursue my interests and start pivoting towards computers and programming. Finding a MSc in Bioinformatics seemed like the perfect at the time, and today I can confirm it. 

Lur, I suggested that same MSc, you hit me back with a PhD. I can only hope our \textit{academic marriage} last a few chapters more.
